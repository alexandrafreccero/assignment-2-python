You start to move away, choosing the mode of “side walking”,
to be able to see where you are going whilst never loosing vision of the object. 
The uncanny feeling you have is attempting to rise towards panic, but you try to keep calm. 
You peer in all directions and the fear you feel is overflowing the silence of this beautiful spring morning.

To your uttermost surprise, you find yourself running towards your home, 
very confused that you do so. “Why am I running” you ask yourself, “ I hate running” 
it is all very strange to you. But anyway, now you are home, and have other things to think about. 
You have no recollection whatsoever of what happened before.
