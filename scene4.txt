The object is elliptic in its form, and has smooth iridescent surface, 
it looks loke a mixture between metal and the skin of a fish. 
But that description is not complete... the really weird thing with this object is,
that the shape seems to be somewhat holographic, You can see it, and at the same time, you see through it. 
Sometimes while looking at it seems that the surface is made of a transparent, glass-like material 
that reveal the metal like structure underneath. 
And sometimes, it is appearing in the opposite way, as if the outer shell is transparent and metallic, 
and underneath it is solid glass.
As you move closer you realise it is a disk, and that it is probably not made on earth.
