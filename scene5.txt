The instinctive reaction our body has is to sit down. Perhaps to lower your pulse or maybe a futile attempt to be less visible on the open field.
You sit there for a moment trying to plan a rational move, but your mind is blanc. You look on your shoes, as if your feet would be able to give you an answer and perhaps a direction. Looking at the shoes really calms you down, “hey, If you can do this, so can I”, you say to them and you take a deep somewhat resigned breath before you keep walking towards the  object.


The object is elliptic in its form, and has smooth iridescent surface, it looks loke a mixture between metal and the skin of a fish. But that description is not complete... the really weird thing with this object, is that the shape seems to be somewhat holographic, You can see it, and at the same time, you see through it. Sometimes while looking at it seems that the surface is made of a transparent, glass-like material that reveal the metal like structure underneath. And sometimes, it is appearing in the opposite way, as if the outer shell is transparent and metallic, and underneath it is solid glass.
As you move closer you realise it is a disk, and that it is probably not made on earth.
